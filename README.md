# ‘The Bespoke Pixel’ syntax theme for Atom

This started life as syntax colouring in BBEdit 4, got migrated to SubEthaEdit, then Textmate, where it absorbed some Monokai, and, with further customisation ended up in Sublime Edit.

Now remodelled to be used as a companion with [the-bespoke-pixel-ui](MarkGriffiths/the-bespoke-pixel-ui) theme for Atom..
